\section{Spreadsheet Tools}

\begin{frame}[t]{Excel}
A \empr{spreadsheet tool} is an interactive software application for structuring, transforming, analyzing and storing data in rows and columns.  You will hear people say such data is in a \textit{tabular format}.
 \\
 \vspace{1.5ex}
\empr{Tabular format}, or  \empr{tabular form}, is simply information presented in the form of a table with rows and columns. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
With the proper permissions and syntax, \href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel}{Excel} has the capabilities to read data from a host of sources or platforms. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
Via the Excel ribbon, choose \texttt{Draw} and then \texttt{Get Data} to review potential sources and platforms.  
\end{frame}

     \vspace{1.0ex}
    \item Resolve duplicate records when appropriate.
  \end{itemize}  
\end{column}
\end{columns}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Issues Resulting from Missing Data}
\empr{Missing values} means that some values exist and others do not exist for the \textit{same row} of data. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
Missing data may seriously compromise inference from randomized experimental designs and observational data, especially if the missing data are not handled appropriately. \\
\vspace{1.5ex} 
The potential bias due to missingness depends on the mechanism causing the data to be missing, and the methods used to ameliorate the consequences of missing data. \\ 
\vspace{1.5ex}
Missing data also adversely affects supervised and unsupervised learners, primarily by reducing prediction and classification accuracy and/or precision.\footnote{For a review of metrics for multi-class classification, see \cite{grandini2020}.} 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Three \underline{Basic} Options to Handle Missing Data}
While one should attempt to identify the missingness mechanism since it will determine the preferred mitigation method, several rather simple options are frequently used in business.\footnote{For an introduction to missing data mechanisms see \cite{jakobsen2017}.}  \\
\vspace{0.5ex}
\small
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The simplest option is to nullify the cells of missing values. This would mean blanking out an Excel cell if the value is (say) ``N/A'', or simply keeping it blank if it is already blank.
  \item The second option is to delete the entire record if there are missing values for the record.
  \item The third option is \empr{interpolation}, which is replacing the missing value with an estimate based on other records. % This would mean finding records that are meaningful and calculating a value for the missing cells based on what is likely to be true.
  One method is \empr{hot-deck imputation}, where each missing value is replaced with an observed response from a ``similar'' record.\footnote{For additional information on hot-deck imputation see \cite{andridge2010}.  The section \textit{Missing Data} of \cite{burke2021c} briefly reviews more advanced techniques to handle missingness.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{A Simple Method to Access Missingness}
To assess the impact of deleting records with missing data one may conduct a simple analysis of a variable with missingness by examining a summary statistic of a variable that does not have missingness. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
For example, one may calculate the average of the variable with missingness for those records with missing values and calculate the average of the variable with missingness for those records without missing values, and then compare the averages. \\
\vspace{1.5ex} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item If the averages do not differ, then deleting the records with missing data may be acceptable. 
  \item If the average values differ a lot, one should collect new data or use advanced imputation techniques rather than deleting missing data.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{A Simple Method to Access Missingness Continued}
Example:  If one is concerned about whether records with missing gender versus records without missing gender have different purchase patterns, one can simply compare the average purchase patterns for missing versus non-missing gender records. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the averages are significantly different, then the missing data are concerning enough that one consider collecting new data or using more advanced imputation methods. 
\item If the averages are not significantly, then many would feel comfortable deleting the records with missing data since missing versus non-missing observations do not seem to matter in terms of purchases.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Outliers}
\empr{Outliers} are those data points that differ noticeably from the other data points. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
Quartiles may be used to identify outliers. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The \empr{first quartile}, typically denoted $Q_1$, separates the smallest 25\% of the data from the largest 75\%. 
\item The \empr{second quartile}, typically denoted $Q_2$, separates the smallest 50\% of the data from the largest 50\%. $Q_2$ is the same as the \empr{median}. 
\item The \empr{third quartile}, typically denoted $Q_3$, separates the smallest 75\% of the data from the largest 25\%.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Interquartile Range Method for Outlier Detection}
The \empr{interquartile range} (IQR) is frequently used to identify outliers.  IQR is equal to subtracting the first quartile from the third quartile.  \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
The \empr{IQR method} for detecting outliers is: \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute the lower outlier boundary:  $O_L = Q_1 - 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$.
  \item Compute the upper outlier boundary:  $O_U = Q_3 + 1.5 \times \text{IQR}$.
  \item Any data value that is less than $O_L$ or greater than $O_U$ is considered to be an outlier.
\end{itemize}
\normalsize
While the IQR method typically works well in practice, other methods exist.\footnote{For a survey of methods, see \cite{aguinis2013}.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{IMDb Data}
\href{https://www.imdb.com/}{IMDb}, launched online in 1990 and now a subsidiary of Amazon since 1998, is the world's most popular source for movie, TV, and celebrity content.  It was designed to help fans explore the world of movies and shows, and decide what to watch. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
IMDb offers subsets of their data  to customers for personal and non-commercial use. While you can hold local copies of the data, it is subject to their terms and conditions.\footnote{Given we will only be using the data for personal class purposes (i.e., not for commercial use), we are in compliance with their Non-Commercial Licensing and \href{https://www.imdb.com/conditions?pf_rd_m=A2FGELUUNOQJNL&pf_rd_p=3aefe545-f8d3-4562-976a-e5eb47d1bb18&pf_rd_r=F27NY89W6WHX7CDGGP5S&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_t=60601&pf_rd_i=interfaces&ref_=fea_mn_lk2}{copyright/license} agreements.} 
\\
\vspace{1.5ex}
This \href{https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/}{page} identifies data location, and the details of each provided data set.  Information provided for each data set includes variable names, variable types (e.g., string), and variable descriptions. 
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Excel Boxplot with Outlier Detection}
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \captionsetup{justification=centering}
    %\fbox{\includegraphics[trim=0cm 9cm 0cm 9cm]{C:/Users/bkwei/OneDrive - Franklin University/Desktop/Math_215/LaTeX_Modules/startYear_frequency_distr2.pdf}}

    \caption{Figure 4: Average Rating Boxplot}
    \label{fig:arboxplot}
\end{figure}
\vspace{-2.0ex}
\small
In Figure \ref{fig:arboxplot}, $Q_1$, $Q_2$, $Q_3$, the sample mean (i.e., 5.95), the maximum, and a \underline{local} \underline{minimum} are shown for IMDb Movie Average Ratings for movies released between 2017 and 2021. Any value less than 2.4 is considered an outlier by Excel;  outliers are shown in \emph{\textcolor{red}{red font}}.  Dependent on the data, Excel may show a \underline{local} \underline{maximum} in lieu of the maximum.\\
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Erroneous Value Formats and Impossible Values}
\empr{Erroneous value formats} are typically words that are meant to be numbers. For example the number of days since last purchase is recorded as ``two hundred'' in lieu of 200. \\
\vspace{1.5ex} 
 \empr{Impossible values} are similar to outliers: they do not belong in the range of acceptable values. For example if the number of days since last purchase, relative to the current date, is 365,000 or -100 there is no need to use the IQR method to determine if the values are extreme; the data are obviously wrong.\\
\vspace{1.5ex}
Many times, data is not in a numerical format. For example the values for a column of data called Gender may be ``Female'', ``Male'', ``Other'', or ``Unknown''. Thus the variables would need to be mapped to categorical variables or indicator variables (e.g., dummy variables).  As a case in point let the variable $X1$ be defined as 1 if Gender is Female, and 0 otherwise.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Content Analysis}
Narrowly defined, \empr{content analysis} is the examination of digital text, photos, audio, or visual formats of communication, which may or may not be extracted from social media. More generally, content analysis includes the careful examination of face-to-face human interactions, analysis of character portrayals in media venues ranging from novels to online videos, computer-driven analysis of word usage in news media and political speeches, advertising, and blogs, examination of interactive content such as video gaming and social media exchanges, and much more.\footnote{For an introduction to content analysis, see \cite{krippendorff2019}.} % More generally, content analysis is the systematic, objective, quantitative analysis of message  characteristics. It includes both human-coded analyses and computer-aided text analysis (CATA).
 \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
Another way to deal with text is to count the number of times a word appears, a basic form of content analysis. This can be done as an analysis for the entire data spreadsheet; such as counting the unique instances of ``Female'', ``FEMALE'', ``female'', ``Male'', ``MALE'', ``male'', \ldots for the variable Gender.    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Data Integration}
Data transformation frequently includes integrating two sources of data. While we will soon cover more advanced ways of doing this task with programming languages, such as with Python or structured query language (SQL) for relational databases, Excel can be used to accomplish a few basic integration tasks. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item Excel offers a way to connect data in two spreadsheets with the \href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vlookup-function-0bbc8083-26fe-4963-8ab8-93a18ad188a1}{VLOOKUP} function. 
\item Another useful Excel data integration option is the \href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/match-function-e8dffd45-c762-47d6-bf89-533f4a37673a}{MATCH} function.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \item Has limited advanced statistics (even with \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-overview}{add-ins}).
  \item To fully master Excel you need to learn \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/library-reference/concepts/getting-started-with-vba-in-office}{VBA}, which has more limited capabilities than R and Python. 
  \item The Excel data file can only hold 1.08 million rows sans the aid of other tools, and its not suitable for processing large-scale data sets.
  \item Unlike R and Python, there is a fee for Excel.\footnote{\href{https://www.google.com/sheets/about/}{Google Sheets} does not charge a fee for tool use.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Python is a general purpose language (GPL). R is a domain-specific language (DSL). 
  \item Python has more big-data supervised (e.g., deep learning), unsupervised learning, and scientific computation capabilities, and data handling modules:  \href{https://numpy.org/}{Numpy}, \href{https://scipy.org/}{SciPy}, \href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/}{scikit-learn}, \href{https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html}{SymPy}, \href{https://pandas.pydata.org/}{Pandas} \ldots. 
  \item R has more statistics and econometric packages available for immediate use. 
  \item While R and Python both have many graphical techniques, R graphics tend to be more elegant and  visually appealing. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

 \begin{frame}[t]{Comparing R and Python Continued}
 \begin{enumerate}
 \setcounter{enumi}{4}
   \item R has many \href{https://cran.r-project.org/}{packages}, about 19,000, where some accomplish the same task.  Python is designed on the \href{https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/}{philosophy} that ``there should be one and preferably only obvious way to do it.'' 
  \item Python is typically easier to learn than R.  However, learning Python libraries can be a bit complex relative to learning R libraries and plots.
  \item R is slower than Python, but not by much.
  \item Python is more popular than R, particularly so in business software engineering (SE) departments.

\section{Variables and Variable Types}

\begin{frame}[t]{Variables and Variable Types}
Excel, R, and Python use variables. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
A \empr{variable} is a storage mechanism for a particular identifier, which contains information referred to as a \empr{value}. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
A variable is like a column of data, and a variable's response values are like rows of data in an Excel spreadsheet, or a \empr{data frame} in R.\footnote{A data frame is a generic R data object, which are used to store tabular data. One may use the Pandas package to create data frames in Python.}  \\
\vspace{1.5ex} 
A \empr{data set} is a collection of related sets of information that is composed of separate elements but can be manipulated as a unit by a computer.  A data frame and an Excel spreadsheet may both be considered a data set.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{A Data Set Example}
\scriptsize
\begin{table}[h!]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{L{2.2cm} L{0.8cm} L{0.8cm} L{1.5cm} L{2.8cm}} 
%\hline
\texttt{Name} &  \texttt{HT} & \texttt{WT} & \texttt{Birth\_Date} & \texttt{Birth\_Place} \\
\midrule  
  Jet Greaves & 6'0'' & 184 & 3/30/01 & Cambridge, ON, CAN \\
  Nolan Lalonde & 6'1'' &  190 & 2/14/04 & Kingston, ON, CAN \\
  Elvis Merzlikins & 6'3'' & 183  & 4/13/94 & Riga, LVA \\
  Daniil Tarasov & 6'5''  & 196 & 3/27/99 & Novokuznetsk, RUS \\
 \midrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:TE}Tender Employees}
\end{center}
\end{table}
\small
\vspace{-1ex}
Some basic features are found in most structured data sets. Information is collected on \underline{individuals, households, persons, firms, animals, plants,} \underline{subjects, items, objects}, \ldots\\
\vspace{1.5ex}
 In Table \ref{tab:TE}, the information collected is on employees. %The individual characteristics are the variables.
The variables of Table \ref{tab:TE}  \texttt{Name}, \texttt{HT}, \texttt{WT}, \texttt{Birth\_Date}, and \texttt{Birth\_Place}. The values of the variables are also called \empr{data}.  \\
 \vspace{1.5ex}
 You may hear some refer to the combination of attributes that result in unique identification as \empr{records} or \empr{observations};  The variable \texttt{Name} of Table \ref{tab:TE} uniquely identifies an employee.  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Common Data Types}
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item \empr{Character}: the variable contains words that do not have order or numerical meaning.  Also called a \empr{string} or \empr{text variable}.  An example is \texttt{Name} of Table \ref{tab:TE}.
\item \empr{Numeric}: the variable contains numbers with decimal points.  May also be called a \empr{decimal}, \empr{real}, or \empr{float}. For example, \texttt{WT} of Table \ref{tab:TE}.
\item \empr{Integer}: the variable contains numbers without decimal points.  For example, we could use \texttt{Birth\_Date} of Table \ref{tab:TE}  to calculate an employee's age in years.
\item \empr{Logical}: the variable contains only two possible values, such as TRUE or FALSE. Also called a \empr{boolean variable}, or an \empr{indicator variable} or \empr{dummy variable} when a variable is mapped to an integer.  As an example, we may create a variable \texttt{NA\_Birth} that equals 1 if Table \ref{tab:TE}'s \texttt{Birth\_Place} country for a \texttt{Name} is in North American, and 0 otherwise.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{First, Second and Third Party Data}

\begin{frame}[t]{Classification of Data Sources}
Marketing uses data from a variety of sources. \\
\vspace{1.5ex} 
%\small
\begin{itemize}
\item \empr{First party data} are a firm's own internal data, such as sales and customer information.
\item \empr{Second party data} are another firm's first party data, shared directly from the source. 
\item \empr{Third party data}, also called syndicated data, are also data from other firms but without a direct relationship or agreement to the customer, such as data scraped from public websites or apps, or data purchased from a provider such as, \href{https://www.iriworldwide.com/en-us}{IRI}, \href{https://www.nielsen.com/}{Nielsen}, \href{https://nielseniq.com/global/en/}{NielsenIQ}, \href{https://www.npd.com/}{NPD}, or \href{https://www.spins.com/}{Spins}.

\begin{frame}[t]{Data Management Platforms}
Marketers need a system to store, organize, and analyze data before it becomes useful and easily understood. A \empr{data management platform} (DMP) is such a solution. A DMP: \\
\vspace{0.0ex}
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item Collects and organizes data so marketers may target specific audiences on \empr{ad networks}.\footnote{Ad networks provide an outsourced sales capability for publishers and a means to aggregate inventory and audiences from numerous sources in a single buying opportunity for media buyers.} 
\item Measures campaign performance across segments and channels to increase marketing outcomes, such as a consumer purchase.
\item Integrates digital marketing data with non-digital data sources (i.e., second and third party data integration).

The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) has an excellent \href{https://www.iab.com/insights/glossary-of-terminology/\#index-3}{glossary} of media terms.}

 These decisions, and forthcoming decisions, affect marketing analytics.  Beyond the alternatives that were mentioned in the Appendix of Module 1, which are now used or could be used, the following have been used or may be used.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A \empr{walled garden} is an environment that controls the user's access to network-based content and services.\footnote{For example, Google has Account IDs that can be linked to first-party user IDs.  Google shares some of its first-party data, usually via a data privacy mechanism, with the firm who has linked its IDs with the Google Account IDs.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Cooked Data and Topics}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1} 
  \item  \empr{Cooked data} are  raw data that has been processed, which may include data that is inferred or imputed.\footnote{For example, if a data set has geographical information about a person such as their zip code, it is possible to infer additional data like income, age or purchase habits, information that is no longer as pervasive due to the consumer protection laws.} 
  \item Google has put forward \href{https://blog.google/products/chrome/get-know-new-topics-api-privacy-sandbox/}{Topics}, a new Privacy Sandbox proposal for interest-based advertising. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Google has a list of 300 topics (for now) that they use to categorize the websites people visit. When a person visits a new website, Google will categorize it into whatever topic it fits best.  
  \item Topics will only show advertising partners three of your interests. It pulls one interest from each week to share with advertisers.
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}[t]{Economic Consequences of GDPR}
\cite{goldberg2024} study the economic consequences of GDPR for a large and diverse collection of online firms.  They examine the effect of GDPR on site traffic, a measure of site health and its capacity to generate advertising revenue, and site revenue arising from e-commerce sales.  \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
Using Adobe Analytics website performance data of 1,084 firms, they show that relative to the prior year recorded page views decrease by 11.7\% and e-commerce revenue decreased 13.3\% from EU users after GDPR implementaion. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
\begin{itemize}
\item However, the data alone do not distinguish between the real and recording effects of the GDPR. 
\item They propose a model to separate GDPR's real effect on the volume of site visits and the GDPR's consent effect on the recording of site visit outcomes. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Economic Consequences of GDPR Continued}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [] 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Under the GDPR recorded economic outcomes may fall because some individuals \underline{do not consent} to data sharing. Indeed, changes to when and what data are recorded is a primary goal of the GDPR. 
      \item At the same time, a decline in recorded outcomes could reflect a \underline{decline in real economic outcomes}, for instance because the regulation restricts personalized marketing.
      \item  Privacy regulation thus creates an inference problem: data protection can both impact economic outcomes and obscure the observation of economic outcomes. Thus policymakers need to distinguish between the real and recording effects of privacy regulation in order to evaluate it.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Economic Consequences of GDPR Continued}
\begin{itemize}
\item They conclude that consent accounts for at least 4.7\% of the recorded page view estimate. 
\item They also provide conservative estimates for the contribution of GDPR's real effect on personalized marketing. The marketing effect alone represents 7.0\% of the recorded page view estimate and 4.6\% of the recorded revenue estimate.
\item Despite concerns of consent fatigue, a substantial minority of EU users make the effort to register their nonconsent preferences. The authors provide evidence that smaller firms obtain lower consent rates, which suggests GDPR may have consequences for competition.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]{Airflow Workflow}
Airflow is a platform that lets one build and run workflows. A workflow is represented as a \href{https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/dags.html}{directed acyclic graph} (DAG), and contains individual pieces of work called \href{https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/tasks.html}{tasks}, arranged with dependencies and data flows taken into account. \\
\vspace{1.5ex}
A DAG specifies the dependencies between asks, and the order in which to execute them and run retries; the tasks themselves describe what to do, be it fetching data, running analysis, triggering other systems, or more. \\

\begin{frame}[t]{Introduction to the Airflow Architecture}
%https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/overview.html
An Airflow installation generally consists of the following components: \\
\vspace{0.0ex}
\small
\begin{itemize}
  \item A \href{https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/concepts/scheduler.html}{scheduler}, which handles both triggering scheduled workflows, and submitting tasks to the executor to run. 
  \item An \href{https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/executor/index.html}{executor}, which handles running tasks. In the default Airflow installation, this runs everything inside the scheduler, but most production-suitable executors actually push task execution out to workers.
  \item A \href{https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server}{web server}, which presents a handy user interface to inspect, trigger and debug the behavior of DAGs and tasks.
  \item A folder of DAG files, read by the scheduler and executor, and any workers the executor has.
  \item A \href{https://docs.astronomer.io/learn/airflow-database}{metadata database}, used by the scheduler, executor and web server to store the state of the process.
